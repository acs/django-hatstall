# Hatstall

Hatstall is a web interface for [SortingHat](http://github.com/grimoirelab/sortinghat) databases developed mainly with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

## What does it try to solve?

Dealing with contributors multi-identities in a development community is an issue in order to get the right metrics about their contributions in the whole project. For example:
* they might be using several usernames in the same data source (i.e. different emails for git commits)
* to get a whole view, you need to take into account their contribution in different data sources (git, issues, chats, etc.). You need to merge multiple usernames under a single unique identity
* they might be working for several organizations during project life

[SortingHat](http://github.com/grimoirelab/sortinghat) is the [GrimoireLab](https://grimoirelab.github.io) tool to deal with all that stuff, but it's CLI might not be very intuitive. So, the learning curve is high, and it takes a long time for a non-tech user to give the right  information to the right identity.

So, Hatstall tries to make easier to deal with multi-identities management in development communities.

## Why Hatstall as a name?

According to [Harry Potter Wiki](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hatstall) **Hatstall** is defined as:

> A Hatstall was an archaic term for a student of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry whose sorting took more than five minutes because the Sorting Hat found them to have a personality equally suited to different Hogwarts Houses. The Sorting Hat sometimes took the student's personal preference into consideration in order to break such a tie.
